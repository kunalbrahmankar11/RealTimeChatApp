## Real Time chat web Application 
The Real-Time Chat Web Application is a modern communication platform built using React.js for the frontend and Spring Boot for the backend.
It enables users to exchange messages instantly using WebSocket technology, ensuring low-latency and seamless communication.
The application supports real-time text messaging, file sharing, and image attachments within private or group chats.
MongoDB is used as the database to store chat history, user details, and file metadata efficiently.
The frontend is designed with a responsive UI to deliver a smooth experience across desktop and mobile devices.
Backend services follow a layered architecture (Controller, Service, Repository) to maintain clean and scalable code.
