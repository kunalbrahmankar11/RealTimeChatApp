## Real Time chat web Application 
The Real-Time Chat Web Application is a modern communication platform built using React.js for the frontend and Spring Boot for the backend. It enables users to exchange messages instantly using WebSocket technology, ensuring low-latency and seamless communication. The application supports real-time text messaging, file sharing, and image attachments within private or group chats. MongoDB is used as the database to store chat history, user details, and file metadata efficiently.
